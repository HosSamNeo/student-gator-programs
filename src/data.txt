The program International Bachelor in Data Science is one of the best programs offered by the school, the teaching units primarily concern Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Statistics and Programming; certainly a great program to choose for your career prospects. International students also have an option to select a foreign university for an exchange semester, thus an opportunity to broaden horizons in the tech world.
